# Learnings

### Summary

- HTML5 Canvas was very effective and animations and handling of game characters.
- Type checking is an essential feature that is required when writing games.
- Instead of maintaining all data emanating from game entities in a 'Data' class, a pairing it with a state machine would have helped maintain code better.
- Avoid janky animations. Smooth animations require calculating delta between frame ticks and adjusting them to the animations.
- Some of the design patterns/concepts I employed to build this game.
   - Dependency Injection
   - Constructor Injection
   - Separation of Concern
   - Encapsulation
   - Facade
   - MVC
